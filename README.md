# Media Portfolio - Thijs Deenen
A web-portfolio showcasing all of the learning goals and outcomes from Thijs Deenen during the 4th semester of the ICT & Media Design course.

## Getting Started
These files will allow you to change and further develop this project, though the project is mainly visible to view either the code, or the finished product on your local machine.

## Notes
The web application was built using the html, css and javascript coding language. Images, Video files, etc. are all placed in the folder where they're expected to be by the code. If files manually get replaced into other folders, the scripts won't recognise the files anymore and errors might occur.

## Built With
Visual Studio Code - The script editor used
FileZilla - The software used for uploading files for webhosting
